# Grimm's Law

Grimm's Law was named after the Grimm Brothers, German philologists, jurists and mythologists, to describe the inheritance of Proto-Indo-European languages.  It brings forth a few clues to understand the roots of vocabularies and the connections between words. The lesson taught by the great teacher Zheng Liu via this [youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7mv6AA6tY8) or this [Baidu Cloud link](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1bn16G5x) inspired me once again. The following four extremely simple rules strengthen my belief that everything has its own tricks. 

## Rule 1: a,e,i,o,u,y (vowels)
Note: The vowels a,e,i,o,u,y are interchangeable.
