# Stress and Syllables

This note serves as a supplementary of the phonetic phonics. The previous blog suggests six rules to pronounce a wide range of English words basic on the spelling. It would be a truly amazing thing if we can spell any words by their pronunciation and  inversely pronounce any words by their spelling. I know even with such a constructive method it is still far from the whole story of phonics. Therefore, I did some research and found several elementary rules to easily place stresses and divide syllables.
