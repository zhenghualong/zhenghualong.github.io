## Lesson 1 -- Finding fossil man

We can **read of** things that happened 5,000 years ago in **the Near East**, where people first learned to write. But there are some parts of the world where even now people cannot write. The only way that they can preserve their history is to **recount** it as **sagas** -- legends handed down from one generation of another. These legends are useful because  they can tell us something about migrations of people who lived long ago, but none could write down what they did. Anthropologists wondered where the remote ancestors of the **Polynesian** peoples now living in the Pacific Islands came from. The sagas of these people explain that some of them came from Indonesia about 2,000 years ago.

But the first people who were like ourselves lived so long ago that even their sagas, if they had any, are forgotten. So archaeologists have neither history nor legends to help them to find out where the first 'modern men' came from.

Fortunately, however, ancient men made tools of stone, especially **flint**, because this is easier **to shape** than other kinds. They may also have used wood and skins, but these have **rotted** away. Stone does not decay, and so the tools of long ago have remained when even the bones of the men who made them have **disappeared without trace**. 

## Lesson 2 -- Spare that spider

Why, you may wonder, would spiders be our friends? Because they destroy so many insects, and insects include some of the greatest enemies of the human race. Insects would make it impossible for us to live in the world; they would **devour** all our crops and kill our flocks and herds, if **it were not for** the protection we get from insect-eating animals. We owe a lot to the birds and beasts who eat insects but all of them put together kill only a fraction of the number destroyed by spiders. Moreover, unlike some of the other insect eaters, spiders **never do the least harm to**  us or our belongings. 

Spiders are not insects, **as** many people think, nor even nearly related to them. One can tell the difference almost at a glance, for a spider always has eight legs and an insect never more than six.

How many spiders are engaged in this work **on our behalf**? One authority on spiders made a **census** of the spiders in a grass field in the south of England, and he estimated that there were more than 2,250,000 in one **acre**; that is **something like** 6,000,000 spiders of different kinds on a football **pitch**. Spiders are busy for at least half the year in killing insects. It is impossible to make **more than the wildest guess** at how many they kill, but they are hungry creatures, not content with only three meals a day. It has been estimated that the weight of all the insects destroyed by spiders in Britain in one year would be greater than the total weight of all the human beings in the country.

## Lesson 3 -- Matterhorn man

Modern **alpinists** try to climb mountains by a route which will give them **good sport**, and the more difficult it is, the more highly it is regarded (重视). In the pioneering days, however, this  was not the case at all. The early climbers were looking for the easiest way to the top, because the **summit** was the prize they **sought**, especially if it had never been attained before. It is true that during their explorations they often faced *difficulties and dangers of the most **perilous** nature*, equipped in a manner which would make a modern climber shudder at the thought, but they did not **go out of their way** to **court** such excitement. They had a single aim, a solitary goal -- the top!

It is hard for us to realise nowadays how difficult it was for the pioneers. **Except for** one or two places such as Zermatt and Chamonix, which had rapidly become popular, Alpine village tended to be **impoverished** settlements cut off from civilisation by the high mountains. Such inns as there were were generally dirty and **flea-ridden**; the food simply local cheese accompanied by bread often twelve months old, all washed down with **coarse** wine. Often a valley boasted no inn at all, and climbers found shelter wherever they could -- sometimes with the local **priest** (who was usually as poor as his **parishioners**), sometimes with shepherds or cheese-makers. Invariably the background was the same: dirt and poverty, and very uncomfortable. For men **accustomed to eating** seven-course dinners and sleeping between fine **linen** sheets at home, the change to the Alps must have very hard indeed.

**Remark:**

* **boast:** sth. boast sth (拥有); sb. boast of sth. (吹嘘、夸耀)
* It is true that...but...: 用法相当于alghough..., 主句

## Lesson 4 -- Seeing hands

Several cases have been reported in Russia recently *of people who can detect colours with their fingers, and even see through solid doors and walls*. One case concerns an eleven-year-old schoolgirl, Vera Petrova, who has normal vision but who can also **perceive** things with different parts of her skin, and through solid walls. This ability was first noticed by her father. One day she came into his office and happened to put her hands on the door of a locked safe. Suddenly she asked her father why he kept so many old newspapers locked away there, and even described the way they were **done up** in bundles.

Vera's curious talent was brought to the notice of a scientific research institute in the town of Ulyanovsk, near where she lives, and in April she was given a series of tests by a special commission of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federal Republic. During these tests she was able to read a newspaper through an opaque screen and, stranger still, by moving her **elbow** over a child's game of Lotto she was able to describe the figures and colours printed on it; and, in another instance, wearing stockings and **slippers**, to make out with her foot the outlines and colours of a picture hidden under a **carpet**. Other experiments showed that her knees and shoulders had a similar sensitivity. During all these tests Vera was **blindfold**; and, indeed, except when blindfold she lacked the ability to perceive things with her skin. It was also found that although she could perceive things with her fingers this ability ceased the moment her hands were wet.

## Lesson 5 -- Youth

People are always talking about 'the problem of youth'. If there is one -- which I **take leave to doubt** -- then it is older people who create it, not the young themselves. Let us **get down to** fundamentals and agree that the young are after all human beings --- people just like their elders. There is only one difference between an old man and a young one: the young man has a glorious future before him and the old one has a **splendid** future behind him: and maybe that is where the **rub** is.

When I was a teenager, I felt that I was just young and uncertain -- that I was a new boy in a huge school, and I would have been very pleased to be regarded as something so interesting as a problem. For one thing, being a problem gives you a certain identity, and that is one of the things the young **are busily engaged in** seeking. 

I find young people exciting. They have **an air of freedom**, and they have not a **dreary** commitment to mean ambition or love of comfort. They are not anxious social climbers, and they have no devotion to material things. All this seems to me to link them with life, and the origins of things. It's as if they were, in some sense, **cosmic** beings in **violent** and lovely contrast with us suburban creatures. All that is in my mind when I meet a young person. He may be **conceited**, ill-mannered, **presumptuous** or **fatuous**, but I do not turn for protection to dreary cliches about respect for elders -- as if mere age were a reason for respect. I accept that we are equals, and I will argue with him, as an equal, if I think he is wrong.

**Remark:**

* **leave:** take leave to do sth. 允许做某事
* That is where the rub is: that is the problem.
	* Passion is the sin of youth.
	* Pride is the sin of middle age.
	* Prejudice is the sin of old age.

## Lesson 6 -- The sporting spirit

I am always amazed when I hear people saying that sport creates goodwill between the nations, and that **if only** the common people of the world could meet one another at football or **cricket**, they would have no **inclination** to meet on the battlefield. Even if one didn't know from concrete examples (the 1936 Olympic Games, for instance) that international sporting contests lead to **orgies** of **hatred**, one could deduce it from general principles.

Nearly all the sports practised nowadays are competitive. You play to win, and the game has little meaning unless you *do your **utmost*** to win. On the village green, where you **pick up sides**(组成队伍) and no feeling of local **patriotism** is involved, it is possible to play simply for the fun and exercise: but as soon as the question of **prestige** arises, as soon as you feel that you and some larger unit will be **disgraced** if you lose, the most **savage** combative **instincts** are **aroused**. Anyone who has played even in a school football match knows this. At the international level, sport is frankly mimic warfare. But the significant thing is not the behaviour of the players but the attitude of the **spectators**: and, behind the spectators, of the nations who **work themselves into furies** over these **absurd** contests, and seriously believe -- at any rate for short periods -- that running, jumping and kicking a ball are tests of national **virtue**.

* **Inclination**
	* My inclination is to agree.
	* have an inclination for sports
	* follow one's own inclinations
* **-cline** 表示倾斜
	* incline; recline; acclivity; declivity; proclivity; cliff
* Adonis; aegis; amazon; Auroral; draconian; Elysian
* **-duce**
	* deduce; deduce; introduce; reproduce; produce; induce; seduce; reduce
* do one's utmost = spare no efforts, stint no efforts, do sth. to the best of one's ability
* 国强不在于大
	1. A country **is not** powerful simply **because** it is large.
	2. The strength of a country **lies not in** its landmass.
	3. It **is not** the landmass **that makes** a country strong.

## Lesson 7 -- Bats

Not all sounds made by animals serve as language, and we have only to turn to that extraordinary discovery of **echo-location** in bats to see a case in which the voice plays a strictly **utilitarian** role.

To get a full **appreciation** of what this means we must turn first to some recent human inventions. Everyone knows that if he shouts in the **vicinity** of a wall or a mountainside, an echo will come back. The further off this solid **obstruction**, the longer time will elapse for the return of the echo. A sound made by tapping on the **hull** of a ship will be reflected from the sea bottom, and by measuring the time interval between the taps and the receipt of the echoes, the depth of the sea at that point can be calculated. **So was born** the echo-sounding **apparatus**, now in general use in ships. Every solid object will reflect a sound, varying according to the size and nature of the object. A **shoal** of fish will do this. So it is a comparatively simple step from locating the sea bottom to locating a shoal of fish. With experience, and with improved apparatus, it is now possible not only to locate a shoal but to tell if it is **herring**, **cod**, or other well-known fish, by the pattern of its echo.

It has been found that certain bats emit **squeak**s and by receiving the echoes, they can locate and **steer clear of** obstacles -- or locate flying insects on which they feed. This echo-location in bats is often compared with radar, **the principle of which** is similar.

**Remark:**

* **interval:** at intervals; at short intervals; at long intervals; at regular intervals
* **receipt:** in receipt of sth. 
 
## Lesson 8 -- Trading standards

Chickens **slaughtered** in the United States, claim officials in Brussels, are not fit to grace European tables. No, say the Americans: our **fowl** are fine, we simply clean them in a different way. These days, it is differences in national regulations, far more than **tariffs**, that **put sand in the wheels** of trade between rich countries. It is not just farmers who are complaining. An electric **razor** that meets the European Union's safety standards must be approved by American testers before it can be sold in the United States, and an American-made **dialysis** machine **need the EU's okay** before it hits the market in Europe.

**As it happens**, a razor that is safe in Europe is unlikely to **electrocute** Americans. So, ask businesses on both sides of the Atlantic, why have two lots of tests where one would do? Politicians agree, in principle, so America and the EU have been trying to reach a deal which would eliminate the need to double-test many products. They hope to finish in time for a **trade summit** between America and the EU on May 28th. Although **negotiators** are **optimistic**, the details are complex enough that they may be **hard-pressed** to get a deal at all.

Why? One difficulty is to construct the agreements. The Americans would happily reach one **accord** on standards for medical devices and then **hammer out** different **pacts** covering, say, electronic goods and drug manufacturing. The EU -- following fine continental traditions -- wants agreement on general principles, which could be applied to many types of products and perhaps extended to other countries. 

**Remark:**

1. kill, murder, execute, put to death, kill yourself, commit suicide, slaughter, massacre, assassinate

## Lesson 9 -- Royal espionage

Alfred the Great acted as his own spy, visiting Danish camps **disguised** as a **minstrel**. In those days wandering minstrels were welcome everywhere. They were not fighting men, and their **harp** was their passport. Alfred had learned many of their **ballads** in his youth, and could vary his programme with **acrobatic** tricks and simple **conjuring**.

While Alfred's little army slowly began to gather at Athelney, the king himself set out to **penetrate** the camp of Guthrum, the commander of the Danish invaders. These had settled down for the winter at Chippenham: thither Alfred went. He noticed at once that discipline was slack: the Danes had the self-confidence of **conquerors**, and their security **precautions** were **casual**. They lived well, on the **proceeds** of **raids** on neighbouring regions. There they collected women as well as food and drink, and **a life of ease** had made them soft.

Alfred stayed in the camp a week before he returned to Athelney. The force there assembled was trivial compared with the Danish horde. But Alfred had deduced that the Danes were no longer fit for **prolonged battle**: and that their **commissariat** had no organization, but depended on irregular raids.

So, faced with the Danish advance, Alfred did not risk open battle but **harried** the enemy. He was constantly on the move, drawing the Danes after him. His patrols halted the raiding parties: hunger assailed the Danish army. Now Alfred began a long series of **skirmishes** -- and within a month the Danes had **surrendered**. The episode could reasonably serve as a unique epic of **royal** espionage!

## Lesson 10 -- Silicon valley

Technology trends may push Silicon Valley back to the future. Carver Mead, a pioneer in **integrated circuits** and a professor of computer science at the California Institute of Technology, notes there are now work-stations that enable engineers to design, test and produce chips right on their desks, *much the way an editor creates a newsletter on a Macintosh*. As the time and cost of making a chip drop to a few days and a few hundred dollars, engineers may soon be free to let their imaginations **soar** without being penalized by expensive failures. Mead predicts that inventors will be able to perfect powerful customised chips over a weekend at the office -- **spawning** a new generation of garage start-ups and giving the U.S. a jump on its foreign **rivals** in getting new products to market fast. 'We've got more garages with smart people.' Mead observes. 'We really thrive on anarchy.'

**And on Asians**. Already, orientals and Asian Americans constitute the majority of the engineering staffs at many Valley firms. And Chinese, Korean, Filipino and Indian engineers are graduating in **droves** from California's colleges. As the heads of next-generation start-ups, these Asian innovators can **draw on** customs and languages to forge tighter links with crucial Pacific **Rim** markets. For instance, Alex Au, a Stanford Ph.D. from Hong Kong, has set up a Taiwan factory to challenge Japan's **near lock on** the memory chip market. India-born N. Damodar Reddy's tiny California company reopened an AT&T chip plant in Kansas City last spring with financing from the state of Missouri. Before it becomes a retirement village, Silicon Valley may prove a classroom for building a global business.

## Lesson 11 -- How to grow old

Some old people are oppressed by the fear of death. In the young there is a justification for this feeling. Young men who have reason to fear that they will be killed in battle may justifiably feel bitter **in the thought that** they have been **cheated of** the best things that life has to offer. But in an old man who has known human joys and sorrows, and has achieved whatever work **it was in him to do**, the fear of death is somewhat **abject** and **ignoble**. The best way to overcome it -- so at least it seems to me -- is to make your interests gradually wider and more impersonal, until **bit by bit** the walls of the ego recede, and your life **becomes increasingly merged in** the universal life. An individual human existence should be like a river -- small at first, narrowly contained within its banks, and rushing passionately past **boulders** and over waterfalls. Gradually the river grows wider, the banks **recede**, the waters flow more quietly, and in the end, without any visible break, they become merged in the sea, and painlessly lose their individual being. The man who, in old age, can see his life in this way, will not suffer from the fear of death, since the things he cares for will continue. And if, with the decay of **vitality**, weariness increases, the thought of rest will be not unwelcome. I should wish to die while still at work, knowing that others will carry on what I can no longer do, and **content in** the thought that what was possible has been done.

	* In him I see a future leader.
* become/be merged in = be blended in
* bit by bit: little by little; inch by inch; gradually
* banks: family & social environment (childhood & adolescence)
	* boulders & waterfalls: adversity & success (youth & middle age)
	* the banks recede: middle age -> old age
	* become merged in the sea: the last journey of one's life



## Lesson 12 -- Banks and their customers

When anyone opens a current account at a bank, he is lending the bank money, repayment of which he may demand at any time, either in cash or by *drawing a **cheque** in favour of* another person. Primarily, the banker-customer relationship is that of **debtor** and **creditor** -- who is which depending on whether the customer's account is in credit or is overdrawn. But, in addition to that basically simple concept, the bank and its customer owe a large number of obligations to one another. Many of these obligations can give rise to problems and complications but a bank customer, unlike, say, a buyer of goods, cannot complain that the law **is loaded against** him.

The bank must obey its customer's instructions, and not those of anyone else. When, for example, a customer first opens an account, he instructs the bank to **debit** his account only **in respect of** cheques drawn by himself. He gives the bank **specimens** of his signature, and there is very firm rule that the bank has no right to authority to pay out a customer's money on a cheque on which its customer's signature has been forged. It makes no difference that the **forgery** may have been a very skilful one: the bank must recognize its customer's signature. For this reason there is no risk to the customer in the practice, adopted by banks, of printing the customer's name on his cheques. If this **facilitates** forgery, it is the bank which will lose, not the customer.

## Lesson 13 -- The search for oil 

The deepest holes of all are made for oil, and they go down to as much as 25,000 feet. But we do not need to send men down to get the oil out, as we must with other mineral deposits. The holes are only **borings**, less than a foot in diameter. My particular experience **is largely in** oil, and the search for oil has done more to improve deep drilling than any other mining activity. When it has been decided where we are going to drill, we put up at the surface an oil **derrick**. It has to be tall because it is like a giant **block and tackle**, and we have to lower into the ground and haul out of the ground great lengths of drill pipe which are rotated by an engine at the top and are fitted with a cutting bit at the bottom.

The geologist needs to know what rocks the drill has reached, so **every so often** a sample is obtained with a coring bit. It cuts a clean cylinder of rock, from which can be seen the **strata** the drill has been cutting through. Once we get down to the oil, it usually flows to the surface because great pressure, either from gas or water, is pushing it. This pressure must be under control, and we control it by means of the mud which we circulate down the drill pipe. We **endeavour to** avoid the old, romantic idea of a **gusher**, which wastes oil and gas. We want it to stay down the hole until we can lead it off in a controlled manner.

**Remark:**

* every so often = very often

## Lesson 14 -- The Butterfly Effect

Beyond two or three days, the world's best weather forecasts are speculative, and beyond six or seven they are worthless.

The Butterfly Effect is the reason. For small pieces of weather -- and to a global forecaster, small can mean thunderstorms and **blizzards** -- any prediction **deteriorates** rapidly. Errors and uncertainties multiply, cascading upward through a chain of turbulent features, from **dust devils and squalls** up to **continent-size eddies** that only satellites can see. 

The modern weather models work with a grid of points **of the order of** sixty miles apart, and even so, some starting data has to be guessed, since ground stations and satellites cannot see everywhere. But suppose the earth could be covered with sensors spaced one foot apart, rising at one-foot intervals all the way to the top of the atmosphere. Suppose every sensor gives perfectly accurate readings of temperature, pressure, humidity, and any other quantity a **meteorologist** would want. Precisely at noon an infinitely powerful computer takes all the data and calculates what will happen at each point at 12.01, then 12.02, then 12.03 ...

The computer will still be unable to predict whether Princeton, New Jersey, will have sun or rain on a day one month away. At noon the spaces between the sensors will hide fluctuations that the computer will not know about, tiny deviations from the average. By 12.01, those fluctuations will already have created small errors one foot away. Soon the errors will have multiplied to the ten-foot scale, and so on up to the size of the globe.

## Lesson 16 -- The modern city

In the organization of industrial life the influence of the factory upon the physiological and mental state of the workers has been completely neglected. Modern industry **is based on** the conception of the maximum production at lowest cost, in order that an individual or a group of individuals may earn as much money as possible. It has expanded **without any idea of** the true nature of the human beings who run the machines, and **without giving any consideration to** the effects produced on the individuals and on their descendants by the artificial mode of existence **imposed by** the factory. The great cities have been built **with no regard for us**. The shape and dimensions of the skyscrapers depend entirely on the necessity of obtaining the maximum income per square foot of ground, and of offering to the **tenants** offices and apartments that please them. This caused the construction of **gigantic** buildings where too large masses of human beings are crowded together. Civilized men like such a way of living.

Obviously, it has not been planned for the good of its inhabitants.

# Lesson 18 -- Porpoises

*There has long been a **superstition** among **mariners*** that porpoises will save drowning men by pushing them to the surface, or protect them from sharks by surrounding them in defensive formation. Marine Studio biologists have pointed out that, **however intelligent they may be**, it is probably a mistake to credit dolphins with any motive of lifesaving. On the occasions when they have pushed to **shore** an unconscious human being they have much more likely done it out of curiosity or for sport, as in riding the bow waves of a ship. In 1928 some porpoises were photographed **working like beavers** to push ashore a waterlogged **mattress**. If, as has been reported, they have protected humans from sharks, it may have been because curiosity attracted them and because the scent of a possible meal attracted the sharks. Porpoises and sharks are natural enemies. It is possible that upon such an occasion a battle ensued, with the sharks being driven away or killed.

Whether it be bird, fish or beast, the porpoise is intrigued with anything that is alive. They are constantly after the turtles, who peacefully **submit to** (忍耐) all sorts of indignities. One young **calf** especially enjoyed raising a turtle to the surface with his **snout** and then **shoving** him across the tank like an **aquaplane**. Almost any day a young porpoise may be seen trying to turn a 300-pound sea turtle over by sticking his snout under the edge of his shell and pushing up **for dear life**. This is not easy, and may require two porpoises working together. In another game, as the turtle swims across the **oceanarium**, the first porpoise **swoops** down from above and **butts** his shell with his belly. This knocks the turtle down several feet. He no sooner recovers his equilibrium than the next porpoise comes along and hits him another crack. Eventually the turtle has been butted all the way down to the floor of the tank. He is now satisfied merely to try to stand up, but as soon as he does so a porpoise **knocks him flat**. The turtle at last gives up by pulling his feet under his shell and the game is over.
