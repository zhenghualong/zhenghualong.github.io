The measure \\(\mu\\)is called $\sigma$ **-finite** if $X$ is the *countable union*  of measurable sets with finite measure. A set in a measure space is said to have $\sigma$ **-finite measure** if it is a countable union of sets with finite measure.

For example, Lebesgue measure on the real numbers is not finite, but it is $\sigma$ -finite. Indeed, consider the closed intervals $[k,k+1]$ for all integers $k$; there are countably many such intervals, each has measure 1, and their union is the entire real line.
